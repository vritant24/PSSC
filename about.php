                 Established in 2005, the mission of Purdue Science Student Council is to provide academically oriented services
                 to the students of the College of Science and to promote professional growth amongst Science students.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 PSSC is also responsible for representing Science students in academic and extra-academic concerns and for serving
                 as a liaison between students and faculty to both Science and University administrations for concerns or recommendations.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Lastly, PSSC strives to foster close relationships among all Science departments in order to promote common interest and
                 communication.
